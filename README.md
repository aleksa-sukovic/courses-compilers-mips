# MIPS college work

This repository contains college problems, examples and homerworks from Compilers class.

We implemented a wide range of algorithms using MIPS assembly, as introduction to actuall compiler construction.

In the end we went from writing MIPS program manually, to writing a program (compiler) which generates MIPS code.
